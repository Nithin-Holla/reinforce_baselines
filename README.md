# Baseline Techniques for REINFORCE Algorithm in Policy Based Reinforcement Learning

Four techniques compared on [CartPole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/) environment:
1. REINFORCE with whitened returns
2. REINFORCE with learned learned value function as baseline
3. Self-critic with greedy rollout
4. Self-critic with sampled rollout
